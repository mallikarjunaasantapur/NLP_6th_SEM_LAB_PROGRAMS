Natural language processing refers to the branch of
computer science and more specifically the branch of 
artificial intelligence, concerned with giving computers
the ability to understand text and spoken words in much 
the same way human beings can. Human language is filled with
ambiguities that make it incredibly difficult to write software
that accurately determines the intended meaning of text or voice
data. Homonyms, homophones,sarcasm, idioms, metaphors, grammar
and usage exceptions,variations in sentence structure. These
just a few of the irregularities of human language that take
humans years to learn, but that programmers must teach natural
language driven applications to recognize and understand 
accurately from the start if those applications are going to be
useful.
